Description about my game:
Bomb is 15 * 15 grid based game.
The bomb will wait 3 sec and explode for 1.5 sec. 
When they explode, it will generation a fixed explosion area. The explosion will clear the path and also decrease player or enemy life by 1 if they are passing through the area. 
Player and enemy will both have 3 life values at the start of the time.
Player needs to move to avoid the bombs and try to kill the enemy by placing their bomb.
Enemy is designed randomly placing the bombs and chasing the player.
When enemy catches the player, it will also put bombs to try to kill the player.
The score is based on the degree of path damage. The more obstacle is cleared, the higher the score.
